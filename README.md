# Tau-norm-multi-machine-scheduling

AMPL and Matlab codes for the minimization of the tau-norm of completion time variances in parallel machines. To replicate the instances associated to the three applications, run the following scripts from the Matlab command line:

- Main_Data_1.m (for the Nursing Home Management);
- Main_Data_2.m (for the IT Troubleshooting Service);
- Main_Data_3.m (for the 311 Call Centers).

To replicate the large instances with n = 90, 180, 270, 360 jobs, run the following scripts from the Matlab command line:

- Main_SimulatedInstances.m .

This programs required to have IBM ILOG-CPLEX installed in your machine.
